# RockBoxes
RockBoxes is going to be a eLearning matching game. 
Anyone will be able to create a copy of the game and customize it to make their own game. They will be able to upload an image and then designate areas of the image to label. They will also be able to upload labels or terms to match with areas on the image. There will also be a system to provide a user score.
